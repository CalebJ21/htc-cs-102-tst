# Week 2 (Classes)
## Warm-Up
Programming often involves representing real-life concepts in code. Have students describe concepts in programming terms using variables/functions. Exact code is not necessary but can be a stretch goal.
- Take 10 minutes to do this while getting setup
- Think – Pair – Share
- When done call randomly on groups

## Instruction

### Introduce Git
- Git PPT

### Introduce Classes
- Conceptually about combining data and methods that operate on that data
- Fields
- Methods
- Object Instances

During the lecture, the students can follow along and build up a simple Console app. They should add a new `Dog.cs` file, and implement the `Dog` class in that file. There is a challenge in the lecture where they will implement a method on the Dog class.

### Introduce WPF
Start from scratch to show the students how to create a WPF application, and add some XAML. Introduce the following concepts:
- `TextBox`
- `TextBlock`
- `Button`
- Button click event handlers

Instructors can build up to the ClassesIntro solution, and show how classes interact with the main window.

## Practice
- note sp2019 - maybe use the warmup items for this

Send the students to the whiteboard in three groups, and have them design a C# class for a restaurant. They should think about what information is important to store about a restaurant. They should start at the conceptual level, simply figuring out how the data should appear. Then, they can attempt to build that template into an actual class. They can follow the instructions in the [RestaurantClass](RestaurantClass.md) guide.
